# MY-SCRAPERS
This repo contains a couple of data scraping scripts to be used for machine learning and data science pet projects. <br>
Currently there are two scrapers:
- [www.wikiart.org]: ~ 180 000 images of artworks along with available metadata, e.g. author, genre, style, etc.
- [www.sreality.cz]: ~ 5 000 for sale local property profiles along with detailed apartment metadata and price.
